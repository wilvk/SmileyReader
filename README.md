Description:

Increase your reading speed and prevent reading regressions by using this app to guide your reading and keep a consistent pace. 

Reading regressions are when the same text is re-read by the reader to comprehend the text and are common when reading but are preventable by guiding your reading. Guided reading can increase reading speeds by up to 20 percent initially. 

With books a finger can be used to guide reading. With reading large amounts of text online, it is more difficult to use your finger to guide the text and so this app is useful in helping guide your reading and measure your reading speed. 

On-screen graphs indicate to you how many words you are reading and how long it is taking as well as showing the number of words per minute read over time.

Two modes are available for reading - Arrow Image Guiding and Text Highlighting. Various options allow pauses after each line, stopping after a set time, and scrolling. An on-screen display gives the current reading time, word count and words per minute.
